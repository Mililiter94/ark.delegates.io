        <p>ARK delegates differ in what requirements they place upon their voters. Some delegates require you to hold a minimum amount of ARK to receive payouts; some delegates won't pay out votes from wallets holding ARK over a defined maximum. We've done our best to collect those requirements here, but you should always reach out to your delegate to confirm should you have further questions.</p>

            <p>Some delegates withhold a portion of their payouts to new voters in order to discourage vote-hopping. Some delegates scale their voters into full payouts gradually, while others simply require voters to last through a "waiting period" before receiving rewards. Once you find a good delegate, it pays to stay loyal.</p>
